1. Build the timer to actually read the actual photoresistive sensor
    DONE, but I haven't checked that it's implemented beautifully. I'd like to do that myself, I guess?
2. Build the interrupt to blink the light when a button is pressed (button will simulate the door sensor for now)
3. Build the Queue and corresponding task, to read from the queue and write (what will be OLED) to the UART
4. Build a timer to handle IR sensor and Mic sensor readings
5. Make the sensors all write to the OLED queue
6. Turn the Queue from UART to OLED (maybe make it use both?)
7. Set up task priority (and figure out how to test it!!)
8. Actually integrate the IR sensor
9. Acutally set up the Hall sensor. test it at wire lengths equal to distance to the door.
